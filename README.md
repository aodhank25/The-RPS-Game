# The RPS Game - A Rock Paper Scissors game.

For the second assignment with the Code Institute, I have created a classic version of the Rock Paper Scissors game. The game is single player only and the user will try gather as many points as possible. The user will have three choices while the computers will be randomly assigned. 

The rules of the game are the same as the original ; Rock beats scissors. Scissors beat paper, and paper beats rock. The game is kept easy, simple and fun.

The main target of the site is people who just want to have a bit of fun or maybe explore some simple JavaScript.
